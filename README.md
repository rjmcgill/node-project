# My Node Project: Simple D&D Character Storer
This is my node project. It is a program that allows you to store simplified D&D characters.

In case you need further explination, D&D is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game where you can make characters with certain abilities and classes.
This program lets you store information about the characters, such as their names, level, race, class, as well as other important information. It also allows you to create classes
for the characters, which dictates the special abilities that the character will have. For example, a Paladin is able to cast spells and mainly uses strength and charisma.
